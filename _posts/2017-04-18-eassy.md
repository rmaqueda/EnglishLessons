**Many changes, I'm in!**

I started playing with computers at a very young age with a present to Three Wise Men’s gift.
I was probably eleven or twelve years old when arrived from the Far East my first PC, the brand-new Amstrad CPC-464, an icon of the 80's.

At this time many revolutionary changes occurred in the world of computer science and I was fortunate to experience then first hand.
Since that moment I don’t remember a long period of time without being in front of a computer. Little by little I was deluding with became a IT worker.
I wasn’t good studient but thanks to my passion and a lot of non-formal training I got it.

Almost everyone thinks that a computer worker can fix any gadget made silicon but there are many and very different areas and require great specialization.
I specialized for almost two decades on Unix Systems and Storage areas. Large computers, usually in large companies, with surprising storage capacity but controlled by commands by a simple text terminal.

Although it’s an exciting world for various reasons now I’m working in a different area, the smallest personal computers that exist: Mobile phones.
They are small devices but they bring together many of the great innovations: GPS, photo and video camera, Internet, touch screens, etc.

In a short time have happened many things. It’s difficult to imagine what the future will be like but you can count me in.
